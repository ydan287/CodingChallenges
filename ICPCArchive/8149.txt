Solution:
first convert the problem into a graph so we can determine the true cost and prestiege of every dish.
i used hash table (unordered map<string,int>) for that.
topological sort on the graph. O(|dishes|+|N|)
BFS on the sorted dishes to update the true cost and preistiege.
solve knapsack problem using a table[B+1][|dishes|] and calculating bottom up.
