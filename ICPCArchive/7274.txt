Solution:
The Solution was the concept that it is not possible to count only one canvass because at the end only 2 remains.
this was the spark that led to the idea to count numbers of paintings from the end. the first painting we will count should be the one we count most
 and there for should be the smallest numbers.
. by counting the lesser pair each time, i found a way to optimize the solution.
the data structure i used to pull the minimal values each time was min heap (priority queue).
complexity O(nlogn)
