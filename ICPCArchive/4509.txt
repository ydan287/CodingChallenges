Description:

the solution uses Belman-Ford algorithm, where every spot in the graveyard is a vertex.
spot with with gravestones has no in or out edges and spots with holes has out edges with weight =t, 
any aother spot has only edges to the neghibor spot with weight =1.
if there exist a negetive circle (WHO is not reachable from start or end) the solution prints never.
if no path- impossible.
otherwise the length of the shortest path. time comlexity O(|V|^3) which means (W*H)^3.
