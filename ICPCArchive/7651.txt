Description:
we used dynamic programming with memoization. the answer had to calculate for each H D the multinomial (H-1 choode x1,x2,,,xd)
we used the recursive eqquation for multinomial and avoided symetry.
complexity: hard to tell since it is calculating the multinomial and generating multinomia both recursive functions.
