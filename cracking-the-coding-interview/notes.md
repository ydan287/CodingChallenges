# Notes

instead of array or vector of booleans use vectorbit - [isUniq](./array-and-strings/isUniq.cpp)

When iterating two strings with two indexes use while loop and break.

StringBuilder: without it concatanating strings would take O(n^2) - (n=number of strings) because every append means creating a new string and copying all charachters. StringBuilder works by using a resizable array. another solution is sometimes to figure out the size of the array before initiating it.
